# Block Level Vs Inline elements

Elements that occupy full row and doesnt allow other elemnt to come beside it, are block level elements. On the other hand elements that dont take width and they allow other elments to be beside of them.

*Note*: This rule is for sibling, children have no effect

**Div** is example of block level and **Span** for inline elments.
